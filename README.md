## Remove Windows Defender from a Windows ISO

>Requires a Windows 8/10/11 ISO Image
>
1Ô∏è‚É£. Extract from ISO or download or extract an valid install.wim from Windows 8 or newer Windows versions.  
2Ô∏è‚É£. After selecting the .wim file, you can press ```"Y"```, ```"N"```, ```"E"``` by following section.  
3Ô∏è‚É£. After the settings was applied, you can save changes into ```install.wim``` or into ```ISO Image Disc```.  
4Ô∏è‚É£. Or you can do into single **command**

```PowerShell
DefenderRemover.exe installwimmount <#(Option to disable/enable/remove defender from .wim image)#> export.iso
```

## Disabling / Removing Defender for a install.wim/install.esd file

Needs and Windows ISO Image mounted or from a CD/DVD drive or from USB Flash Drive.

(The letter of drive is detected automaticly by the script)

**!Attention**  This requires 8 - 16 GB of space in C:\ (it creates a folder named MountedDefenderRemover in C:\ and mounts Windows Image in that folder)

**!Attention** If the disc image contains install.esd source file, the script will convert into a .wim file before running the disabler/remover process.

After the process is configured , the ISO Image will be saved in ``` c:\defenderRemovedISO\WindowsDefenderRemovedImage.iso ```
After Applying the script with desired option, the device will reboot automaticly.  
Before to start the script, an automatic system restore point is created. If something fails, can be restored easily.  

## üõë Why is this downloaded app/script being flagged as a virus?

That is a false positive.

Some Security apps flag this app as a virus because of the inclusion of IoBit Unlocker, or the way the .exe files are created.

Also, you can download the (*.zip) version.  
The Antiviruses that flag this script as a virus are MalwareBytes and BitDefender (as Heuristic), maybe it has to do with how the exe file is created.

## üìÉ Instructions for the (*.zip) version of the Defender Remover  

1Ô∏è‚É£. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/jbara2002/windows-defender-remover/releases/latest) of the Script from the [Releases](https://github.com/jbara2002/windows-defender-remover/releases) section.  
2Ô∏è‚É£. Extract into a location.
3Ô∏è‚É£. Open Script_Run.bat and choose the menu.  
4Ô∏è‚É£. Like the (*.exe) version, wait until the device reboots.

## Disable and/or Remove Windows Defender *Application Guard Policies* (deeper)

If you have some problems when opening an app (*extremely rare*) and it will be saying "The app can not run because Device Guard" or "Windows Defender Application Guard Blocked this app" you must remove 4 files (with the same name, from 4 different locations).

The location of the files are:

a. In EFI Partition

```PowerShell
$Path_To_EFI_System_Partition\Microsoft\Boot\WiSiPolicy.p7b
```

b. In Code Integrity Location

```PowerShell
$env:windir\System32\CodeIntegrity\WiSiPolicy.p7b
```

c. In Windows Folder

```PowerShell
$env:windir\Boot\EFI\wisipolicy.p7b
```

d. In WinSxS Folder

This module is not added to the script because implementing the removal of the file from the EFI partition is impossible (for now) to implement.

 Manually removal: Go to "C:\Windows\WinSxS" and Search for **winsipolicy.p7b** then delete the file.

i.e:

```PowerShell
[IO.DirectoryInfo]::New("$env:windir\WinSxS").GetFiles("*", [IO.SearchOption]::AllDirectories).Where({ $_.Name -eq "winsipolicy.p7b" }) | Remove-Item -Force
```

## **Frequent questions**

1Ô∏è‚É£. How to use the package remover without downloading the executable from the release?

**RESPONSE:** Run the desired ".bat" file from cmd with PowerRun (by dragging to the executable). You must reboot to take effect of the removal.

2Ô∏è‚É£.  What are the ideal conditions for running the remover version of the script?

**RESPONSE:** The "ideal" condition is to run the Remover Version of the script on a Clean Installation of Windows. Why do I recommend that? Because the "Windows Intelligence Update" would not be installed and thus no defender package.
