## üõë Why this downloaded app/script is taked as virus?
The app is false positive. Some Security Apps it take this app as a virus because the inclusion of IoBit Unlocker, or the way of the .exe creation.
Also , you can download the (*.zip) version.  
The Antiviruses which this script as a virus : MalwareBytes and BitDefender (as Heuristic), maybe the way which was created the exe file.

# Disable and/or Remove Windows Defender Application Guard Policies (deeper)
If you have some problems when open an app (extreme rare) and it will saying "The App it can not run because of Device Guard" or "Windows Defender Application Guard Blocked this app" you must remove 4 files (with same name , from 4 different locations).

The location of the file are:

a. In EFI Partition
```
<EFI System Partition>\Microsoft\Boot\WiSiPolicy.p7b
```
b. In Code Integrity Location

```
<OS Volume>\Windows\System32\CodeIntegrity\WiSiPolicy.p7b
```

c. In Windows Folder

```
C:\Windows\Boot\EFI\wisipolicy.p7b
```
d. In WinSxS Folder

This model is not added into script because the implementation of the removal the file from EFI partition it is impossible (for me) to implement.

1. Go to "C:\Windows\WinSxS" and Search for __winsipolicy.p7b__
