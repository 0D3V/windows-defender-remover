## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions
#### ‚≠ï How to remove Windows Security Center / Windows SecurityApp from PC without downloading Script?
Paste this code into a powershell file and after **Run as Administrator**.
```
$remove_appx = @("SecHealthUI"); $provisioned = get-appxprovisionedpackage -online; $appxpackage = get-appxpackage -allusers; $eol = @()
$store = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Appx\AppxAllUserStore'
$users = @('S-1-5-18'); if (test-path $store) {$users += $((dir $store -ea 0 |where {$_ -like '*S-1-5-21*'}).PSChildName)}
foreach ($choice in $remove_appx) { if ('' -eq $choice.Trim()) {continue}
  foreach ($appx in $($provisioned |where {$_.PackageName -like "*$choice*"})) {
    $next = !1; foreach ($no in $skip) {if ($appx.PackageName -like "*$no*") {$next = !0}} ; if ($next) {continue}
    $PackageName = $appx.PackageName; $PackageFamilyName = ($appxpackage |where {$_.Name -eq $appx.DisplayName}).PackageFamilyName 
    ni "$store\Deprovisioned\$PackageFamilyName" -force >''; $PackageFamilyName  
    foreach ($sid in $users) {ni "$store\EndOfLife\$sid\$PackageName" -force >''} ; $eol += $PackageName
    dism /online /set-nonremovableapppolicy /packagefamily:$PackageFamilyName /nonremovable:0 >''
    remove-appxprovisionedpackage -packagename $PackageName -online -allusers >''
  }
  foreach ($appx in $($appxpackage |where {$_.PackageFullName -like "*$choice*"})) {
    $next = !1; foreach ($no in $skip) {if ($appx.PackageFullName -like "*$no*") {$next = !0}} ; if ($next) {continue}
    $PackageFullName = $appx.PackageFullName; 
    ni "$store\Deprovisioned\$appx.PackageFamilyName" -force >''; $PackageFullName
    foreach ($sid in $users) {ni "$store\EndOfLife\$sid\$PackageFullName" -force >''} ; $eol += $PackageFullName
    dism /online /set-nonremovableapppolicy /packagefamily:$PackageFamilyName /nonremovable:0 >''
    remove-appxpackage -package $PackageFullName -allusers >''
  }
}
```

#### ‚≠ï Why is the downloaded executable being flagged as a virus?

That is a false positive.

Some security apps flag this app as a virus because of the way the ".exe" files are created. Download with **git** or source code .zip will indicate virus-free.
Starting with Defender 12.6.x , some versions are considered as virus, some are not (its a bug from me, so do not file for this).

#### ‚≠ï Why is the patch not working when Windows is updated?

Windows Update includes a ```Intelligence Update``` which blocks certain actions and modifies Windows Defender/Security policies.
If the script is not working for you, check if you have the Windows Security Intelligence Update installed. If you do, disable tamper protection, and re-run the script.

#### ‚≠ï How to use the package remover without downloading the executable from the release?

Run the desired ".bat" file from cmd with PowerRun (by dragging to the executable). You must reboot for the changes to take effect.

#### ‚≠ï How to disable VBS if the removal script does not work

Disable with this command and reboot.

```
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
```
